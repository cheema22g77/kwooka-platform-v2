# Heavy Vehicle National Law (HVNL)

## Part 1 - Preliminary

### Section 3 - Object of Law
The object of this Law is to establish a national scheme for facilitating and regulating the use of heavy vehicles on roads in a way that:
- Promotes public safety
- Manages the impact on road infrastructure
- Encourages productive, efficient and innovative heavy vehicle operations

## Part 2 - Chain of Responsibility

### Division 1 - Chain of Responsibility Duties

#### Section 26C - Primary Duty
A party in the chain of responsibility for a heavy vehicle must ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety of the transport activities relating to the vehicle.

#### Chain of Responsibility Parties
- Employers of drivers
- Prime contractors
- Operators of heavy vehicles
- Schedulers of goods or passengers
- Consignors of goods
- Consignees of goods
- Loaders of goods
- Unloaders of goods
- Loading managers

### Section 26D - What constitutes transport activities
Transport activities means activities associated with:
- The use of a heavy vehicle on a road
- The loading of goods onto or unloading from a heavy vehicle
- The operation of a heavy vehicle

### Section 26E - What is reasonably practicable
Reasonably practicable means that which is reasonably able to be done, taking into account:
- The likelihood of a safety risk eventuating
- The degree of harm from the risk
- What the person knows or ought to know about the risk
- Ways to eliminate or minimise the risk
- The availability and suitability of ways to eliminate or minimise risk
- The cost of eliminating or minimising risk

### Quality Indicators for Chain of Responsibility
26C.1 All parties in the chain are identified and documented
26C.2 Safety management systems address CoR risks
26C.3 Contracts include CoR obligations
26C.4 Due diligence processes are in place
26C.5 Records demonstrate reasonable steps taken

## Part 3 - Vehicle Operations

- Axle group mass limits
- Bridge formula compliance

### Quality Indicators for Mass Management
92.1 Weighing systems calibrated and certified
92.2 Load documentation accurate
92.3 Drivers trained in mass compliance
92.4 Pre-departure mass checks conducted

### Division 3 - Dimension Requirements

#### Section 93 - Dimension limits
A person must not use a heavy vehicle on a road if the vehicle exceeds a dimension limit.

#### Dimension Categories
- Overall length
- Overall width
- Overall height
- Rear overhang
- Front overhang

## Part 4 - Vehicle Standards

### Division 1 - Roadworthiness

#### Section 94 - Heavy vehicle must be roadworthy
A person must not use, or permit to be used, a heavy vehicle on a road unless the vehicle is roadworthy.

#### Roadworthiness Requirements
- Braking systems operational
- Steering systems functional
- Tyres in safe condition
- Lights and reflectors working
- Coupling equipment secure
- Load restraint equipment adequate

### Quality Indicators for Vehicle Standards
94.1 Daily pre-trip inspections conducted
94.2 Defect reporting system in place
94.3 Maintenance schedules followed
94.4 Roadworthy certificates current
94.5 Defects rectified before vehicle use

## Part 5 - Driver Fatigue

### Division 1 - Work and Rest Requirements

#### Section 218 - Standard hours (solo drivers)
Solo drivers must comply with:
- Maximum 12 hours work in any 24 hour period
- Maximum 72 hours work in any 7 day period
- Maximum 14 hours work in any 24 hours with 15 min breaks
- Minimum 7 continuous hours stationary rest in 24 hour period
- Minimum 24 continuous hours stationary rest in 7 day period

#### Section 219 - BFM hours (Basic Fatigue Management)
BFM accredited drivers may work:
- Maximum 14 hours work in any 24 hour period
- Maximum 144 hours in any 14 day period
- With appropriate rest breaks

#### Section 220 - AFM hours (Advanced Fatigue Management)
AFM accredited operators determine work/rest through risk management.

### Quality Indicators for Fatigue Management
218.1 Work diaries completed accurately
218.2 Electronic Work Diary (EWD) records maintained
218.3 Rest breaks taken as required
218.4 Scheduling allows legal rest periods

### Division 2 - Work Diaries

#### Section 224 - Work diary requirements
A driver of a fatigue-regulated heavy vehicle must:
- Record all work time
- Record all rest time
- Make entries before starting work
- Make entries at end of each work period
- Keep work diary for 28 days
- Produce diary on request

#### Work Diary Record Requirements
- Driver name and licence number
- Vehicle registration
- Employer/operator details
- Date and time of entries
- Work/rest periods
- Location at start and end of each entry
